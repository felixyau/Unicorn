# Unicorn - Your Personal Health Assistant

## Intro
Unicorn is a platform where we provide smart health technology, including 247 health monitoring, prediagnosis machine learning model and Healthipedia, a health information database.
<br  /><br  /><br  />
## Main Features  
### - Prediagnosis machine learning model  :hospital:
We make use of KNN ML algorithms to predict whether a user has potential illnesses. By collecting a set of symptoms-related answers from users, we will compare the data with our database and offer medical advice and suggestions accordingly.

<br  />

### - health dashboard  		:bar_chart:
A dashboard that allows data import from health devices, e.g. smart watches, summarising health data for constant monitoring and recording.
<br  />

### - Healthipedia  :information_source:
A Health database to power the other functions. We filter trustworthy and valid information for generating medical advices and suggestions.
<br  /><br  /><br  />

## Tech Stack
- Frontend    
We decided to use React because of its massive community support and popularity. On top of that, we chose to use Next for the ease to create multiple-page websites with better SEO. The programming language is Typescript, considering that it has much better scalability than JavaScript.
<br  />

- Backend  
We will use Django to integrate with our Machine Learning model. We have not held down any type of database to use. In terms of scalability and cost-efficiency, we will integrate our server with cloud providers like AWS. 
<br  />

For the API we will just use the Django Rest API.
<br  /><br  /><br  />
