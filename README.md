# Unicorn - Your Personal Health Assistant


## Intro
Unicorn is a platform where we provide smart health technology, including 247 health monitoring, prediagnosis machine learning model and Healthipedia, a health information database.

## Main Features
prediagnosis machine learning model


## Tech Stack
For the frontend, we decided to use React because of its massive community support and popularity. On top of that, we chose to use Next for the ease to create multiple-page websites with better SEO. The programming language is Typescript, considering that it has much better scalability than JavaScript.

For the backend, we will use Django to integrate with our Machine Learning model. We have not held down any type of database to use. In terms of scalability and cost-efficiency, we will integrate our server with cloud providers like AWS. 
For the API we will just use the traditional Rest API.
